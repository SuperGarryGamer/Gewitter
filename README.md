# Gewitter
A discord.js bot that tells you the weather.

## How to use
The simplest way to use the bot is to [invite it](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=938916359063101470&permissions=0&scope=bot%20applications.commands) to your Discord server.  If you would like to host your own, separate instance, you must create a Discord application, and an account at [WeatherAPI.com](https://www.weatherapi.com/). Place the bot token and the API key in the .env file.
